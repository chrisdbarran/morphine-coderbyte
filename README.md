My Coderbyte scripts &amp; tests

I'm using the Coderbyte challenges to improve my JavaScript.

I prefer to work in a test driven mode which isn't really facilitated by the CoderByte inteface.
I develop each challenge as a Node module and run the tests via mocha. 
When I'm happy I copy and paste into CoderByte. If it fails I write more tests and repeat.
